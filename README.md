## Food Waste Reduction
There is a lot of extra food waste generated by homes & restuarants. We plan to help waste converting industries indentify the best locations to make a certain product using a particular kind of food waste, like a recycling method. Another idea was to distribute the extra food to local food banks or orphanages nearby.

### How it Works ?
We basically collect the information of homes or hotels through a form in our web app in React & store it as JSON files. We planned to display this data of specific food waste & their concentration on a map but we couldn't integrate it. We are currently showing the map of the user's location separately & a random heat map in Flask using Python.
