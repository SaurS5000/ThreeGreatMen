## Food Waste Reduction
There is a lot of extra food waste generated by homes & restuarants. We plan to help waste converting industries indentify the best locations to make a certain product using a particular kind of food waste, like a recycling method. Another idea was to distribute the extra food to local food banks or orphanages nearby.

### How it Works ?
We basically collect the information of homes or hotels through a form in our web app in React & store it as JSON files. We planned to display this data of specific food waste & their concentration on a map but we couldn't integrate it. We are currently showing the map of the user's location separately & a random heat map in Flask using Python. 
(Embed video of project demo, TODO)

### Technologies used
React JS for the web app & Flask for the geographic heat map API.

### How to configure
Install Folium & Flask libraries for the Python Flask API file. Install the respective dependencies in the React project. We can see the dependencies in package.json or package-lock.json.

### How to Run
Run React using 'npm run start' & run Flask with the execute command.
